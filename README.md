FluxBB
======

FluxBB is an open source addon that integrates FluxCP into FluxBB forum engine by http://fluxbb.org

Unlike many forum softwares, FluxBB is designed to be smaller and lighter without many of the less essential features. Often features which aren't included in the core are implemented by the community and released as modifications. The below feature list shows what features are included in a standard install of FluxBB.

For more features and what is supports in detail, you may found it at http://fluxbb.org/about/features.html\
